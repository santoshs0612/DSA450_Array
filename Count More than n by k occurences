Given an array arr[] of size N and an element k. The task is to find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 8
arr[] = {3,1,2,2,1,2,3,3}
k = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 and
 2 are the only elements that appears 
more than n/k times.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {2,3,3,2}
k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 and 2 
are the only elements that appears more 
than n/k times. So the count of elements 
are 2.















class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times.
    int countOccurence(int arr[], int n, int k) {
        // Your code here
        map<int,int> mp;
        int count=0;
        int comp= n/k;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            mp[arr[i]]++;
        }
        for(auto i=mp.begin();i!=mp.end();i++)
        {
            if(i->second>comp)
            {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
